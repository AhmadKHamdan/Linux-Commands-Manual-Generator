# Generation Part
This project is a Command Manual Generator implemented in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The purpose of the application is to generate manuals for command-line tools, based on their usage patterns, descriptions, versions, examples, related commands, and recommendations for similar commands.

# Verification Part
The verifyCommandManual function and the getCurrentCommandInfo function work together to compare the information stored in an XML file with the current state of the command manuals obtained by executing commands directly.
Together, these functions allow you to ensure that the information stored in the XML file, which presumably was generated previously, is still accurate and up-to-date with the current state of the commands on the system. It's a form of validation or verification mechanism to maintain the correctness of the command manuals over time
